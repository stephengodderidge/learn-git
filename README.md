# learn-git-tutorial

A tutorial for those looking to get started using git and github. Originally used on campus at BYU.

Git might not get you a job, but it will certainly be an every day tool. It's how world-class dev orgs ship applications. Let's get started!

> PS - I'll be focusing on GitHub here, but all of the same concepts apply to BitBucket, GitLab, or any other git-based storage site. The UI might look different, but they're all based on the same underlying tech (git).

> PPS - Don't worry, I won't let the git puns git in our way.

The README of this repo is the tutorial, but you'll use the rest of the files to practice forking, committing, open a PR, etc. This won't teach you everything, but I hope it gives you enough of a base if you get stuck in any sticky situations.

## Pre-requisites:

1. You have git installed on your machine
2. You have setup your git config with your email and git username. See the section `Your Identity` in [the First Time Git Setup documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) if you haven't done this step. You can make sure that you've done this step by running `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`.
3. You have [created an account on Github](https://github.com/signup).

## Tutorial Overview

> Git is a [distributed version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control). Let's break down what that means...

### Version Control System

You are probably familiar with a "version control system," although, you might not call it that. Have you ever edited a Word document and called it something like `My Document_final_FINAL.docx`? Voila! Little did you know, but you were using your very own version control system.

But if you have named your files in this way, you know it is difficult to keep track of all the files and the various changes you made across files. This is where Git shines! When you use Git you will only have one file version on your computer at a time and Git will track all of the file versions and history for you behind the scenes! Then you can compare versions or switch back to an old version whenever you need.

### Distributed Version Control System

Git is a **_Distributed_** version control system because it not only allows you to track versions of files on your computer but across your devices, team members' computers, and servers. Git enables easy remote backup and collaboration with your team! No more emailing `.zip` files or passing around [punch cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era). ðŸš€

### Tutorial Steps

This tutorial is designed as a team assignment where you can learn to use Git as a powerful collaboration tool. The tutorial will be divided into two parts. In the first part, one team member will do the initial setup of a shared project where all the team members can contribute. The second part will consist of every team member making code changes on their machine and then combining the code into the shared project.

Here is the tutorial breakdown:

#### Part 1 (One Team Member)

1. Fork This Repository
2. Give edit permissions to your team

#### Part 2 (All Team Members)

3. Create a feature branch on your local repo
4. Add a python script to a new folder
5. Commit your changes
6. Push your local feature branch to your remote repo (your fork)
7. Pull down latest changes from master
8. All team members contribute to newly created repository

## Part 1 - Setup Team Repository

Alright! Pick one team member that will do the initial project setup and then let's git to it! ðŸ˜‰

### Step 1: Fork This Repository

> Repository (Repo): A folder that holds your code. This folder is special because it has a hidden `.git` folder that holds information about how your repository has changed over time.

Instead of adding your changes directly to someone else's repo, you can create a copy of their repository to work with. When you create this copy, we call it "forking the repository."

Conceptually, think about hitting a fork in the road -- the road splits into two. This is the same with forking in git. Forking simply creates a snapshot of the base repository (`chingtong/learn-git`) that you have permission to make changes to.

After you fork your repo, your newly-created repo will be referred to as a "fork." This might sound weird, but just go with it. I promise it will stick eventually.

1. Make sure you're on the base page of the `learn-git` repository: [https://github.com/chingtong/learn-git](https://github.com/chingtong/learn-git).
2. In the top right-hand corner, you'll see a button that says `Fork`. Click it. You'll see a screen that shows "Forking repository". You'll now find yourself on a new repo page. If you look in the top left, you'll see that this repo is based on your `<your-github-username/learn-git>`.

Congrats! You've created a fork! This is simply a copy of the base repository `chingtong/learn-git`. We will use this new repository as a place for your team can share code.

> Now is a good time to copy the url for your new repository (e.g. `https://github.com/<your-github-username/learn-git>`) and share it with your team. They will use it in Step 3

### Step 2: Give edit permissions to your team

> You will need your team members' github usernames or email addresses for this step.

Your team members need edit permissions to the team repository so they can save their code there without requiring your approval.

Add new repository collaborators by going to `Settings > Collaborators` then clicking `Add people`. Add all of the members of your team. They should all receive a github notification where they can accept your invitation to collaborate on the repo.

> **Bonus step: Prevent unwanted changes to `master` branch**
>
> > _If any of the terms here are confusing, don't worry! You can skip this step and come back to enable branch protection at any time_
>
> We want to protect our code against unwanted or accidental changes. For example, it is possbile to accidently delete the version history of our repository. Yikes!
>
> Navigate to `Settings > Branches`, then in the `Branch protection rule` section click `add rule`. In the "Branch name pattern" box type `master`.
> Then enable the following settings:
>
> 1. Require a pull request before merging
> 2. Require approvals
> 3. Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
> 4. Do not allow bypassing the above settings
>
> Then click `Create`
>
> This step will protect your `master` branch from unwanted changes. Based on the settings above, changes to `master` will require that another team member review your code before it can be saved via a `pull request`

## Part 2 - Team Collaboration (feat. Git)

Okay now that everyone has access to the team repository, it is time for everyone to put their hands to the keyboard so we can practice collaborating with Git. Let's code!

### Step 3: Clone Your Newly-Created Team Fork

You'll need to clone your team's forked repository to your local environment. "Clone" might just sound like a fancy way to say "download", but cloning keeps the connection between the remote repository (in GitHub) so you can add our changes (commits) back to the remote. By the end of this step, your will have cloned the repository into a folder on your computer.

1. Go to your team's fork and hit the green "Code" button. Select HTTPS.
   > There are several ways to clone the repository, including SSH and GitHub's own command-line interface. We're going to keep it simple and go with HTTPS.
2. Copy the link in the box. This link is the url to the repository. It should look something like https://github.com/your-username-here/learn-git.git
3. If you're on a Mac, open your terminal. If you're on windows, use Git BASH. I'm not a PC user, but I'm fairly certain you can download Git BASH on [gitforwindows.org](https://gitforwindows.org/)
4. Navigate to the parent directory you'd like to download it to.
5. Type the following command: `git clone <insert-the-https-url-here>`

And Ta-da! You've officially cloned the repository onto your local machine. Navigate to your repository by running a quick `cd learn-git`

### Step 4: Create a feature branch on your local repo

Now that you're on your local repository, you can focus on making our changes. Your assignment is to create a folder, add code to the same file, make pull requests, pull down latest changes, and manage any merge conflicts. Yes, very complicated. It's basic, but the goal is to learn git. You'll create a folder with a name of your choice with a `.py` file inside. Feel free to name your script whatever you want, commit it to your local repo, push your changes to your fork, and open a repo. Phew, that's a lot! Don't worry, you'll focus on creating the feature branch in this step.

1. Make sure you're in the root of your local repo. Use `cd` to get there. To make sure you're on the master branch, run `git status`. The output will show you your current branch. If you're not on your default branch, run the command in step three to switch back. We'll come back to `git status` in a minute.

> (Feature) Branch: A git branch is like an alternate history for your code. In most repositories the branch where your working version lives is called something like `master`, `main`, or `prod`. If you want to try out some changes or build a new feature, you can create a new branch to ensure the other branches of your code won't be affected. When you are ready to add your feature back to the working version you _merge_ the feature branch into `master`.

2. Run `git branch {any-branch-name}`. This creates a snapshot (a branch) of your current branch (`master` in this case) named `{any-branch-name}`. You could have named this branch whatever you'd like (ex: `git branch covid-sucks`). In this case, you'll be adding our simple script to this branch.

3. Now that you have our new branch created, you need to switch our current branch to the new branch. You refer to this process of branch switching as "checking out a branch." Run `git checkout {any-branch-name}`. Now, run `git status` to confirm that the current branch as `{any-branch-name}`.

4. BONUS - in the future, when you create branches, you can use `git checkout -b {insert-branch-name}` as a shortcut to `git branch` and `git checkout`. This is the same thing as running `git branch {any-branch-name} && git checkout {any-branch-name}`. Personally, I _always_ use `git checkout -b`.

And voila! You've created your feature branch. You're all set to make these changes.

### Step 5: Add a folder structure and upload to your repository

In this step, you're going to add a script. The important part is that you're going to make changes locally, commit those changes to our feature branch, and ultimately you'll be pushing these changes to our fork.

Before we jump in. Everyone in your group number off from 1-4. We will be splitting up work to make it more collaborative and experience how it feels to contribute to the same repo as your group.

Person 1:

1. Open the `learn-git` folder in your code editor.
2. Add a new folder with a name of your choice.
3. Create a file and name it whatever you may like. Example: i_love_code.py

Now you're ready to move on and actually commit your changes!

### Step 6: Commit your changes

Committing your changes adds your changes to the current branch. Before you commit your changes, you have to _stage_ your changes. This step may seem trivial when you're working on a few files (especially in our case), but this step becomes more helpful as you work on more files at once.

> Think of an assembly line that creates new cars. The cars are assembled, and they go to a separate location for a quality check before shipping out to the customer. This is what your staged changes are. You work on a bunch of changes locally, and then stage the changes (quality check) before they're finally committed (shipped to the customer). Once you've staged your changes, you can review your changes before finally committing them.

Think of committing your staged changes as saving your changes to your repository. Follow the steps below, and we'll come back to this question.

Person 1:

1. Make sure you saved your new empty `.py` file.

2. Run `git status` to see the files that have been changed. You should see a `Changes not staged for commit:` section. Underneath, you should see the file path to your new script. These are changes that you have saved to your files, but they aren't currently setup to be committed yet. _Your changes aren't staged yet_. In fact, you'll need _add_ them to the staged files before you can commit them.

3. Run `git add {insert_your_folder_name}/{insert_your_script_name}.py`. This step adds the file to the files staged for the commit.

   > Note -- if you'd like to stage all of the files you've made changes to locally, you can simply run the shortcut `git add .` instead of adding each file individually.

4. Run `git status` again to confirm the changes have been added to the staged files. You should see a `Changes to be committed:` section. Underneath, you should see the new file path. This means your files are ready to be committed.

5. Run `git commit -m "add my new folder/file"`. This commits the changes, and allows us to add a git commit message at the same time. Now, our branch has been updated to point to this new commit.

6. Run `git status` to check that the files have been added. You should see a message that says `nothing to commit, working tree clean`

And voila! You've committed your changes.

Now, back to the question â€“ _How is saving your files on your computer different from committing your changes to your repository?_ Committing your changes bundles all of your changes into a single commit and adds that commit to your branch. Once your branch includes this new commit, you are able to push your changes up to your remote repository. From there, someone else could pull your changes, create a branch from your branch, and start adding new commits (not a spoiler alert at all). By stringing these commits together, the repository has an accurate view of the current state of the branch.

Once you have several commits on a branch, you can choose to do a whole host of different actions - undo (wipe away the changes completely), unstage (un-commit the changes, and add them to the unstaged files on your local workspace), and more.

### Step 7: Push your local feature branch to your remote repo (your fork)

Now that you have your changes committed, you need to _push_ those changes to your remote repository, which is a fork of the original `learn-git` repository. At the end of this step, your remote repository will include your feature branch.

1. Check which branch you're on by running `git status`. If you're not on your feature branch, go ahead and checkout that branch with `git checkout {insert-branch-name}`.

   > Note -- If you don't remember the name of your branch, you can run `git branch` in your terminal and it'll display all the branches you have locally.

2. Run `git push`. Git should automatically display a message similar to:

   ```
   The current branch my-animal has no upstream branch.
   To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

       git push --set-upstream origin my-animal

   ```

   Don't worry, nothing is wrong. Git is simply helping us with your next step. Git is telling you that you need to set the upstream branch of your local branch to the remote copy (origin). Phew, that was a lot. Let's break it down.

   So, what is `origin`? This is the term that git uses to refer to a remote repo. In our case, origin is our remote repository (our fork). The upstream branch is the branch tracked on the remote repository by your local branch. So, in our case, we're setting up our local branch to track any changes that happen in our origin's (our fork's) branch. When would this be useful? Well, say we have multiple developers making changes to a feature branch. We need a way to pull down the latest commits

   [More on that in this helpful article](https://devconnected.com/how-to-set-upstream-branch-on-git/#:~:text=Upstream%20branches%20define%20the%20branch,set%20upstream%20branches%20on%20Git.)

3. Do as git suggests and run `git push --set-upstream origin {insert-branch-name}`. You'll see a bunch of update statements like `resolving deltas` and `Writing objects:`. This means git is pushing your local branch to your remote repo. You'll also see a helpful line that should read something similar to this:

```
remote: Create a pull request for 'my-animal' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/<insert-your-github-username>/learn-git/pull/new/my-animal
```

Copy this URL. You're going to need it in a minute!

4. Bonus -- go to your fork in your browser. In the top left corner, you should see a button that says `Master`. Click it, and see that your branch is there. You can open you branch and navigate to your script. You should be able to see your changes. Pretty cool right?

### Step 8: Open a Pull Request

Our next goal is to add our commits to the master branch of our newly created `learn-git` repo so others can see our script and make changes if they'd like. In order to do this, you need to submit a request to pull those changes into the repo. In other words, you need to open a **pull request**.

This Pull Request needs to be approved by the owners of the repository before it can be _merged_ into master. Different companies have different approval processes (example: multiple reviewers from different teams), but our use case is simple. You're simply focused on opening the pull request.

1. Open a request by going to the link in the last step of Step 6. It should look like `https://github.com/<insert-your-github-username>/learn-git/pull/new/{insert-branch-name}`. This should take you to a page with the title of **Open a pull request**.
2. Name your Pull Request whatever you want. Add some comments if you'd like.
3. Once you've added your PR name and comments, go ahead and click the `Create Pull Request`.

Congrats! You've opened your first pull request!! Go ahead and take a look around at the different tabs. See if you can find where you can view your changes (Hint: look for files). You can also view your commit(s).

### Step 9: Approve a Pull Request

Now that the pull request has been created, it needs to be reviewed, approved, and merged into our `master` branch.

Since Person 1 has given edit permissions to the whole group and they cannot approve their own pull request. Let's have the person with the nearest birthday in the remaining group (Person 2, 3, or 4) be the approver.

1. Navigate to the Pull Requests tab on GitHub, the url should look something like `https://github.com/<insert-your-github-username>/learn-git/pulls`
2. Navigate to Files Changed tab
3. Click Review Changes, click `Approve` radio button, and add a comment if you would like, and press submit!

   > Note -- It is not good practice to approve a pull request without thoroughly reading over the code and ensuring that what we are putting into master is good code. However, since this tutorial is focused more on git principles rather than coding principles, don't stress too much about mulling over the one line print statement.

4. Once the pull request has been approved, Person 1 can go ahead and merge the pull request.

Ta daaaa! You have now reviewed a PR, approved the code, and now the code exists in master! We want the whole team to be able to try this whole process that we walked through.

### Step 10: Rinse and Repeat

Starting with Person 4 and going backwards, you will now repeat the steps we just walked through. This is your time to collaborate together and try to remember what we have learned so far.

1. Pull down the latest code in master
2. Add a print statement to your `.py` file. This can be anything you want. You can share your favorite joke, animal, etc. An example could be:

   ```python
   print("My favorite animal is a dolphin")
   ```

3. Save your file and make a commit containing your changes
4. Create a pull request
5. Ask a group member to approve your pull request
6. Merge your request.
7. Repeat until all group members have contributed to your repo.

   > Note: If you want to see an example of what I did, you can look in the `favorite-animals` folder and the `.py` file with my first and last name.

# And We've finished the Tutorial! Pat yourself on the back, you're well on your way to mastering git. If you have spare time, consider trying to manage a merge conflict, rebasing your pull request instead of merging, or reverting a commit.

### Topics Not Covered

This tutorial doesn't cover these topics, but they're still useful to know after you've learned everything included above:

- **How to undo your last commit** - See the second answer to [this post on Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/927358/how-do-i-undo-the-most-recent-local-commits-in-git).

- **How to view your current changes in VSCode** - I definitely recommend using VSCode if you can. I run all of my git commands and logic through the command line, but I use the git tab on the far right toolbar to view the changes to my files. See `[the VS Code documentation for more info](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol).

- **How to _Rebase_ Your Feature Branch Onto the latest version of Master** - Let's say you're working on your feature branch for a few days, and the upstream master has been updated, and you need the new changes on your feature branch. The process to do this is called "rebasing". It's a good one to know. I'll work on adding a tutorial for it, but in the meantime, you can always Google "how to rebase my branch onto master" and a Stack Overflow link should pop up.

- **How to Resolve Merge Conflicts** - Let's say you open a PR that changes files that someone else changed _after you created your branch_. Your branch doesn't have these changes, so Git isn't sure how it should treat the order of the commits. This is called a Merge Conflict.
  This is the trickiest part of working in git. This will most certainly cause you headaches in the future. It's worth an entire tutorial by itself. I'm working on adding a full-fledge tutorial, but here are the basic steps: (A) Pull the latest changes from the upstream master into the local master. (B) Checkout the feature branch that has the conflicts. (C) Rebase your feature branch onto master. (D) Use the interactive rebasing process to resolve any conflicts. (E) Force push your changes. Again, I'll add a full-fledge tutorial soon, but hopefully these steps give you a guide for things to Google.

### Terms to be familiar with:

Here are some of the terms we've used in the tutorial. This isn't meant to be a comprehensive git dictionary, but hopefully it helps fill in any gaps you might have after the tutorial.

- **repository** - the git-enabled folder. Think of it as your project folder with a hidden .git folder inside. This repository can have branches, forks, and various commits. The main goal is that it tracks all of the versions of a project, both working and development. AKA "a repo."

- **branch** - think of branches as pointers to a snapshot of your changes. The default branch in git is referred to as `master` or `main`. Branches are used for new feature development. The process to switch to a new branch is called "check out a branch." Each time you create a branch, you create a new snapshot of the branch you currently had checked out.

- **commit** -

  - _verb_: to write your changes to whichever branch you're currently on.
  - _noun_: refers to the new changes themselves. Once you've committed your changes, you can undo those changes by undoing the commit. Git uses hashes to refer to your various commits.

- **remote** - opposite of local. Used to describe a repo that exists in GitHub (or a different git service). By default, your local repo will have one remote: `origin`. You can add other remotes as well. This is helpful when you want to pull the latest changes from the original repository that your fork is generated from (see Step 2.5 above in the tutorial).

- **local** - opposite of remote. Used to describe a repo that exists on your local machine.

- **fork** - a copy of someone else's repository. This new copy is owned by your GitHub user, so you're able to make changes to it. This is a very common approach in the open-source contributing world. See Step 1.

- **pull request** - a request to merge your changes into a branch (usually master). Think of it as a request to _pull your feature branch's changes into the master branch_. Note that these feature branches can be on a fork of the original/upstream/main repo.

- **push** - Used to describe the process of adding your commit to another branch, usually from a local to a remote. Example: _Push your changes (commit) to your remote repo_.

- **pull** - Used to describe the process of adding the changes from one branch to another, usually from a remote to a local. _Pull in the latest changes from the master branch_.

- **master** - Used as the default branch for any repository. There is nothing special about this branch; it's simply the one that is designated as the main branch

  > Because of today's society's realization of systemic racism, there are movements to rename "master" to "main." I think this is an important and necessary shift in our verbiage as developers. GitHub will soon make it the default for all repositories. However, in the meantime, for those learning git, it is still helpful to learn "master" as the default branch. New developers will most certainly come across repos with a `Master` branch and need to be aware of what that means. For this reason, I'm going to continue to use `master/main` to refer to the default branch.

**Did I miss a term? Go ahead and open a PR to add any you think should be added!**
